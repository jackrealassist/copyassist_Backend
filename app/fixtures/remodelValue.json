From a home buyer's perspective, cedar roofs have a few attractive attributes. Depending on factors such as upkeep and climate, a cedar wood shake roof can last 30 to 40 years, significantly longer than a standard asphalt roof. So, while materials and installation have higher up-front costs, it could even out in the end. Many potential buyers like the aesthetic, so when considering cost, don't forget to account for the roof's pitch, complexity, and size, as those factors will also impact your material and labor costs.","image_urls":["https://plunk-images.s3.amazonaws.com/8bf01d6f-e032-4f0b-a47a-029274c9ecdb"],"cost_estimate":{"typical":12000,"min":9000,"max":25000}},{"project_id":"add-full-bath-reclaim-space","display_name":"Reclaim space for a full bath","description":"Reclaiming space for a new full bath should cost between $8,500 and $25,800.
